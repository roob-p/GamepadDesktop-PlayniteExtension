## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works:
- The extension divides the screen into "sections" that can be reached by pressing buttons (default: `LB` and `RB`). It also allows access to specific panels and can launch Playnite functions via shortcuts.
- Use the `Gamepad-Wizard` to edit panel and section positions: simply place the mouse over the indicated points and wait a few seconds. No restart required.
- You can edit the controller layout by editing the `Keys` section in `config.ini`. Almost all buttons can be changed, with few exceptions:
  - When the osk is opened the, `tabjump_next` (RT for default) is used for mouseleft click. `A` is used for press the button of the OnScreen keyboard (this is the only funcion not configurable).
  - You can change the slot with `$explorerAndSlot_back` (`$LS` for default) which also shows/hides the Playnite Explorer panel to the left, and `$FilterAndSlot_back` (`$RS` for default) witch also show/hides the Playnite Filter panel to the right) by long pressing them.
  - Put Playnite in Fullscreen by long pressing `$globalsearch` (`$back` for default) which also is used to open the Playnite Global search with a quick press.
- The default keys are:
  
  -*`(Left Stick)`* `LSX` ‚Üí `$mousemovx` , `LSY` ‚Üí `$mousemovy` (mouse movement)    
  -*`(Right Stick)`* `RSY` ‚Üí `$scroll` (bar scrollI)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:
- Please, make sure to maximize Playnite. It's required for the extension to work properly.   
- On each start, the script loads reachable points from the first slot, under [Global] section. You can also edit them directly open the `config.ini`. [Global.slo2] and [Global.slot3] contains the points of the other slots.
- The extension uses the window title of Playnite Global Search for interacts with Global Search. Since this varies by language, only the most common cases are supported. If you encounter issues, please open an issue and specify your language. In the meantime, switching Playnite to English is recommended.
